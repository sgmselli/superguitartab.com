Database

# Database

We use PostgreSQL for our relational database 

## Production database

Our production database runs inside the same Digital Ocean Droplet VPS as the rest of our app.

When the app scales, we will scale horizontally by moving the database to its own seperate VPS along with a Redis cache for fast API calls and performance.

## Migrations

Migrations are ran using `alembic`. These run [here](../../tabs-api/run.sh) using commands:
- alembic -c app/db/migrations/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate (makes migrations)
- alembic -c app/db/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head (migrates changes)

We leave `alembic -c app/db/migrations/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate (makes migrations)` commented out as we make our migration files outside of docker.

To make a migration

1. Ensure you set up your own local postgres database on your local machine using psql.
2. Run `docker compose down` in compose folder so docker app isn't running
3. Change `.env` file so your `DATABASE_HOST=localhost`
4. At tabs-api run migration commands (should successfully run and create new migration version file in `tabs-api/app/db/migrations/versions`)
5. Change `.env` file back so your `DATABASE_HOST=guitartabsdb`
6. Start app up using Docker with `alembic -c app/db/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head (migrates changes)` uncommented in `run.sh`.

Migration should be applied!
